### Instructions

1.  Write a program using the programming language that you chose in Assignment 1 if applicable. Note that this program is NOT related to your project, and itâ€™s just to show me you are ready for (or start to learn) the programming language. If you choose the paper option, you can use any language that you prefer.
2.  The program is to implement the Breath-First Search algorithm from the textbook, Page 100. Or you can find the algorithm from the slide L02, Page 28.
3.  Use the test case shown in Fig. 3.15 to generate a trace shown in Page 101. Or you can find the figure and trace at Page 27 of the slide L02.
4.  On top of your main file, add comments to provide the following information: programming language: C++, Java, Python, etc.; Version: C++ 11, Python 2 or 3, etc.

### Notes
* This program performs a _searching_ algorithm, therefore returns _true or false_ when a node is found.
